# Project 0 - Tic Tac Toe

## Intro
The aim of this project was to utilise the skills I have learned so far to create a game of tic tac toe (noughts and crosses) in a browser.

## Live Site
[Click here](https://jeremyetzine.github.io/tic-tac-toe/game.html) for the live site.

## What does it do?
The project allows for two people to play tic tac toe by clicking on the squares where they want to put their O or X. They can use custom usernames if they like. The game can detect the end of the game and announces the winner or draw. There is also a reset button.s

## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript ES6
- jQuery

## Bugs
There is a bug where if a player wins in a certain way or attempts to lose in under 6 moves, the game can get confused and randomly award a winner and or end the game later than expected.

## To-Do

- Add color themes - (ocean and lava)
- (maybe) Fill empty spaces - screen looks very bare
- Add ai
- Fix the bug
- Size control for devices of all sizes - phones etc
