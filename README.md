# Project 0 - Tic Tac Toe

## Intro
The aim of this project was to utilise the skills I have learned so far to create a game of tic tac toe (noughts and crosses) in a browser.

The project allows for two people to play with custom usernames and announces the winner or draw.

## Live Demo
[Click here](https://jeremyetzine.github.io/tic-tac-toe/) for the live site.

## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript ES6
- jQuery

## To-Do

- Finish setting up "winner/draw" screen
- Fix potential spacing issues on larger displays
- (maybe) Fill empty spaces - screen looks very bare
