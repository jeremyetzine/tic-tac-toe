# Project 0 - Tic Tac Toe

## Intro
The aim of this project was to utilise the skills I have learned so far to create a game of tic tac toe (noughts and crosses) in a browser.

## Live Site
[Click here](https://jeremyetzine.github.io/tic-tac-toe/game.html) for the live site.

## What does it do?
- Renders a game board in the browser
- Switches turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
- Visually displays which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw if neither wins
- Includes separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Includes a reset button
- Uses Javascript for DOM manipulation
- Allows players to select usernames and includes the usernames in the end game display
- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)


## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript ES6
- jQuery

## Bugs
There is a bug where if a player wins in a certain way or attempts to lose in under 6 moves, the game can get confused and randomly award a winner and or end the game later than expected.

## To-Do

- Add color themes - (ocean and lava)
- (maybe) Fill empty spaces - screen looks very bare
- Add ai
- Fix the bug
- Size control for devices of all sizes - phones etc

## Fun
Boom button that gets rid of the game!
